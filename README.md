* **module-role-declarative** : A group of playbooks and roles used to demonstrate the differences between modules, roles, and using declarative APIs all through ansible.  
  
* **asm-block-ip-address** : A playbook that takes in a variable array of IPs and creates a F5 BIG-IP ASM policy to block those IP's.  
  
* **asm-block-url** : A playbook that takes in a variable array of URLs and creates an F5 BIG-IP ASM policy to block those URL's.
